Yining Fan
Due December 11, 2020

Data Access 
(A).Rmd Line numbers where at least two difffferent data sources are imported: 20-24 
(B) .Rmd Line numbers for inspecting data intake:  72-75; 81-88
Data Wrangling (5 out of 8 required) 
(A) .Rmd Line number(s) for general data wrangling: 92-105
(B) .Rmd Line number(s) for a join operation: 119-124
(C) .Rmd Line number(s) for a spread or gather operation (or equivalent): 
(D) .Rmd Line number(s) for use of regular expressions: 127-133
(E) .Rmd Line number(s) for use of reduction and/or transformation functions: 107-117
(F) .Rmd Line number(s) for use of user-defifined functions: 
(G) .Rmd Line number(s) for use of loops and/or control flflow: 
(H) .Rmd Line number(s) for use of machine learning (not “wrangling” but scored here): 135-141
Data Visualization (3 of 5 required) 
(A) .Rmd Line number(s) for use of mulitple difffferent geoms: 143-153
(B) .Rmd Line number(s) for use of multiple aesthetics: 143-153
(C) .Rmd Line number(s) for use of layered graphics:

(E) .Rmd Line number(s) for use of decision tree or dendogram results: 
Other requirements (Nothing for you to report in this Guidance Document) 
(A) All data visualizations must be relevant to the stated research question, and the report must include at 
least one effffective display of many–at least 3–variables 
(B) Code quality: Code formatting is consistent with Style Guide Appendix of DataComputing eBook. 
Specififically, all code chunks demonstrate profificiency with (1) meaningful object names (2) proper use 
of white space especially with respect to infifix operators, chain operators, commas, brackets/parens, etc 
(3) use of <- assignment operator throughout (4) use of meaningful comments. 
(C) Narrative quality: The narrative text (1) clearly states one research question that motivates the overall 
analysis, (2) explains reasoning for each signifificant step in the analysis and it’s relationship to the 
research question, (3) explains signifificant fifindings and conclusions as they relate to the research question, 
and (4) is completely free of errors in spelling and grammar 
(D) Overall Quality: Submitted project shows signifificant effffort to produce a high-quality and thoughtful 
analysis that showcases STAT 184 skills. (2) The project must be self-contained, such that the analysis 
can be entirely rerun without errors. (3) Analysis is coherent, well-organized, and free of extraneous 
content such as data dumps, unrelated graphs, and other content that is not overtly connected to the 
research question. 
(E) EXTRA CREDIT (1) Project is submitted as a self-contained GitHub Repo (2) project submission is a 
functioning github.io webpage generated for the project Repo. Note: a link to the GitHub Repo itself 
will be awarded partial credit, but does not itself qualify as a “webpage” of the analysis.
